  // About Secton --------------
  aboutParaOne:
    "I have been building websites since I was a teenager with his first laptop. I was exposed to cryptocurrency in early 2014 and by 2016 I fully believed that this technology was here to stay.",
  aboutParaTwo:
    "In 2019 I dropped out of my batchelor of Coorporate Finance degree to begin learning Solidity Lang. It did not worry me that I only had 6 months left before I would be certified, the ciriculum did not account for the rapidly changing ecosystem that is modern finance, so instead, I chose to change myself.",
  aboutParaThree:
    "I hold a strong conviction for blockchain technology and strongly believe in its longevity. Primarily, I believe in the projects that are building on Web3, as this is the future of the internet. My experience In the field probably lends me a strong bias, and therefore, my views are my own",
